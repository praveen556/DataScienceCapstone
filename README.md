This project is the final requirement for HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone, the final course in the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate. The main goal of this project is to work independently on a data analysis project and apply the knowledge base and skills learned throughout the certification program to a real-world problem. 

The data set analysed in this project is owned and supplied by the Dutch data mining company Sentient Machine Research, and is based on real world business data. 

The analysis in this project aims to get a particular customer profile for those having caravan insurance. It is based on the data set that contains information about customers of an insurance company, and also the results of a marketing campaign “Caravan Insurance Policy”, which has already been performed, that tells if customers were interested in this insurance policy or not. R will be used for the analysis and modelling. The prediction problem we are trying to answer is, given the data, what kind of profile will a customer have that most likely purchase caravan insurance. In addition, we are trying to develop a classification algorithm that can predict which customers from an unseen data set will get caravan insurance so that they can be targeted more by the insurance company while marketing
